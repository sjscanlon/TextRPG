The beginning will involve Arden arriving onto the gunship with nothing but his lightsaber. The middle of the story will consist of Arden searching through the gunship to try to find pieces of a holocron that will provide information for Arden to disable the ship. The end will result in a fight between Arden and a jedi on the bridge of the gunship and then Arden blowing up the gunship with himself on it to ensure victory. The dilemmas are finding all the pieces of the holocron and fighting to the bridge of the ship as well as sacrificing the player character at the end of the story.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[[First Level]]</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[[Docking Bay]]</span></p><p class="indent0">Docking Bay is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">You step into the docking bay aboard the Republic Gunship 'Penance 11'  there is static in your com and then you hear:[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">] [</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'Darth Arden your interception of the Penance 11 as been successful.
