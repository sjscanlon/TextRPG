"Sacrificial Flight" by Steven Scanlon
[[Rooms]]

The story description is "The story will take place in the star wars universe, the player will be controlling a character named Darth Arden, a sith lord, who is infiltrating a rebel gunship to find a way to disable it before it reaches its destination and can assist the republic in their fight on Yavin 4. The beginning will involve Arden arriving onto the gunship with nothing but his lightsaber. The middle of the story will consist of Arden searching through the gunship to try to find pieces of a holocron that will provide information for Arden to disable the ship. The end will result in a fight between Arden and a jedi on the bridge of the gunship and then Arden blowing up the gunship with himself on it to ensure victory. The dilemmas are finding all the pieces of the holocron and fighting to the bridge of the ship as well as sacrificing the player character at the end of the story."
